## Why write an eBook?

I’m a pretty serious lifter and wanted to make lockdown a little easier for anyone missing the gym. My goal was to write a short guide that explained everything you need to know about training with resistance bands. 

I wrote and released **Tension: Build a Bigger, Stronger You With Resistance Band Training**

## Amazon store copy

I didn’t want my book to get lost among all the others. It needed some eye-catching copy to draw potential readers in.

You can read the full copy by visiting [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Tension-Bigger-Stronger-Resistance-Training-ebook/dp/B08W24VNSM/) or scroll down for a few snippets.

The copy was written to make clear how well resistance band training can work.

>If you **train correctly with resistance bands**, you get these **results automatically**. The problem is that most fitness apps and online video programs want you to do ridiculous exercises that are a waste of time.

>This guide only covers things that have been tried and tested. It’s **backed by science** AND **first-hand experience**.

>How to become the **strongest you’ve ever been... without leaving your house.**

I didn’t want the copy to sound too gimmicky, so I added a reality check that won’t put anyone off. Everyone expects *real* exercise to involve hard work.

>In case it wasn’t clear this guide is hyper-focused on getting you the most bang for your buck. It’s not aimed at someone looking for an easy home workout. Training with heavy resistance bands can get you amazing results, but only if you put in the work.

To make sure everyone knew I was an authority figure I dropped in some pretty strong proof.

>I’ve been involved in a variety of strength sports for over a decade. Everything from freerunning, climbing, powerlifting, gymnastics, and martial arts. I’ve spent the last few years focusing on stone lifting. I’ve lifted the fabled **330kg Dinnie Stones**, as well as several of the other named Scottish stones.

I also used a personal anecdote to make the results clear and trigger a little envy. This lets them imagine themselves getting the same results if they buy the book.

> I was wearing a shirt I hadn’t worn recently when my wife said “your back is looking huge, what have you been doing?”

Finally, I finished with a strong CTA.

>**I challenge you** to commit to the basic routine for 12 weeks. Put in the work, follow the program, and results are inevitable!
