## Why did I write an eBook?

I’m a pretty serious lifter and wanted to make lockdown a little easier for anyone missing the gym. Passive income is a nice incentive too! 

My goal was to write a short guide that explained everything you need to know about resistance band training.
 
I wrote and released **Tension: Build a Bigger, Stronger You With Resistance Band Training**

## Amazon store copy

I didn’t want my book to get lost among all the others. It needed some eye-catching copy to draw potential readers in.

</div>

You can read the full copy by visiting [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Tension-Bigger-Stronger-Resistance-Training-ebook/dp/B08W24VNSM/) or scroll down for a few snippets.

The copy was written to make clear how effective resistance band training actually is.

>If you **train correctly with resistance bands**, you get these **results automatically**. The problem is that most fitness apps and online video programs want you to do ridiculous exercises that are a waste of time.

>This guide only covers things that have been tried and tested. It’s **backed by science** AND **first-hand experience**.

>How to become the **strongest you’ve ever been... without leaving your house.**

I was selling it pretty hard. But I didn’t want the copy to sound too gimmicky, so I ‘admitted’ a limitation. The trick is this won’t put anyone off. Everyone expects *real* exercise to involve hard work. By being open, I’ve built trust with my potential reader.

> It’s not aimed at someone looking for an easy home workout. Training with heavy resistance bands can get you amazing results, but only if you put in the work.

To make sure everyone knew I was an authority figure I dropped in some pretty strong proof. Combine this with the trust I just built and the readers view me as an expert.

>I’ve been involved in a variety of strength sports for over a decade. Everything from freerunning, climbing, powerlifting, gymnastics, and martial arts. I’ve spent the last few years focusing on stone lifting. I’ve lifted the fabled **330kg Dinnie Stones**, as well as several of the other named Scottish stones.

I then used a personal anecdote to make the results clear and easy to visualise. This allows readers to imagine themselves getting the same results if they buy my book.

> I was wearing a shirt I hadn’t worn recently when my wife said “your back is looking huge, what have you been doing?”

Finally, I finished with a strong CTA. 

>**I challenge you** to commit to the basic routine for 12 weeks. Put in the work, follow the program, and results are inevitable!

The strength curve is a way of talking about which part of an exercise is hard and easy. Let’s consider a conventional back squat. The hardest bit of the exercise is when you’re at the bottom of the squat. Getting ‘out the hole’ is everyone's weak point. As you get nearer lockout, the exercise gets easier.

“ Imagine having 10% of your weight strapped onto your arm for an entire day! The birds accumulated 5 total days of stretch time and the results were then investigated. The results showed an increase of 16% in anterior latissimus dorsi muscle fibres. In other words – the birds got jacked. You can imagine how this excites bodybuilders!

Obviously, this study doesn’t translate exactly to humans. It does however offer an exciting look into the possibilities of loaded stretching. The huge success in birds inspired many human studies. The results are in: loaded stretching builds muscle fast in humans. Now, before you get overly excited, I want to point out that the results aren’t as freaky in humans. It's much faster than many other methods but you’re not going to be bursting out your shirts in a week.”
