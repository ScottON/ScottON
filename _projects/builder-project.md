## Who are Builder.ai?
An award-winning tech company that makes building software as easy as ordering pizza. 

6x faster and 70% cheaper – no tech skills required. It’s all possible due to their AI-powered approach that uses Lego-like reusable features to quickly bring ideas to life.

## What they needed
They were scaling quickly and needed another writer they could trust. The plan was to grow on all fronts. This meant landing pages, ads, emails, chatbot journeys and content for the site – scroll down for samples.

All the writing needed to adhere to their style guide and match the company's tone of voice. 

And they needed it fast. Builder.ai has a startup-like environment and new ideas can become reality in a matter of days. There was always something new to get stuck into which kept me on my toes.


>**”*Scott's copywriting is both persuasive and effective in delivering against campaign objectives. His ability to write natural copy placing the audience as the subject matter is a skillset which is hard to find. During our time working together Scott has always thrown himself into the campaign planning process, and is always looking to stretch the brief further in order to deliver better results. An absolute pleasure to work with, who you can consistently rely on.*”** – Liam Collins, Head of Performance at Builder.ai

## What I did 
As I said, the work was varied. Everything from work directly promoting their products, to working on their **Microsoft** and **Gumtree** partnerships. Due to NDAs, I’m only going to share materials I have explicit permission to use.

### The big stats:
* 2000% increase in organic traffic
* 4x the number of paid Studio Store deals
* 44% reply rate on an outbound sales cadence (previous best by others was 32%)

### Landing page copy
From sales calls, they’d discovered people were put off by too much tech talk. I was asked to simplify the existing copy. I created messaging that showcased the benefits of [their pre-packaged apps.](https://www.builder.ai/studio-store)

To reach more people and give back to the community, they decided to make these pre-packaged apps free. We started with the [ecommerce app](https://www.builder.ai/studio-store/free-ecommerce-app). I was asked to create a landing page that minimised the tech speak and made it irresistible.

> **“*Scott is the kind of freelancer that you only dream about hiring. He rocked up at Builder.ai amid a load of confusing, technical products and started cranking out warm, friendly guides that made dry subjects come alive. He’s fast too! But whether it’s an email, SEO content or a web page, his words always feel fresh.*”** – Helen Darking, Senior Copywriter at Builder.ai

The pain points the sales team found most effective are included in the copy. And of course, we finished with a recap and a strong call to action. Without going into their specific numbers... in my first 4 months, **paid deals increased 4x**.

I’ve worked on several landing pages for them. I particularly like the one I completed for their [itinerary app](https://www.builder.ai/app-builder/itinerary-app). I wrote it to target travel-app related keywords. It’s an example of SEO copywriting done right – would you know it’s SEO-optimised?

### Ads
I’ve written lots of copy for their ads. The completed creatives were given to me and I created all the supporting copy.

>**”*It is always a pleasure working with Scott. He has an innate ability to craft copy with the customer always first while also keeping to brand tone of voice (he picked this up tremendously fast). His fresh take on our global ad copy has assisted in improving results across the board. He truly is an asset to any organisation!*”** – Loretta Nguyen, Digital Campaign Manager at Builder.ai

### Emails
Everything from welcome emails to re-engagement emails for unqualified leads. They’re designed to be clear, enjoyable to read, and end with a strong CTA.

>**“*Scott is incredibly fast at picking up projects, making sure the copy is on-brand and includes related links. He fits very well within the startup environment delivering his work on time considering the very tight deadlines we often have.*”** – Silvia Gentile Polese, Growth Marketing Manager at Builder.ai

### Content writing
>**"*It was a pleasure to work with Scott. Great attention to detail and very high quality writing. You definitely get your money's worth. He is super fast, professional and SMART! I would recommend him for anyone interested in having a great writer.*"** – Viveka Nand, SEO Manager at Builder.ai

Their **organic traffic increased by over 2000%** in my first 4 months with them.
 
 I wrote many SEO optimised guides, these are some of my favourites:

* [Starting an online business - PSCM method](https://www.builder.ai/guides/starting-an-online-business)
* [Dropshipping for beginners: the complete guide](https://www.builder.ai/guides/dropshipping-guide)
* [Start an online t-shirt business: the complete guide](https://www.builder.ai/guides/start-online-t-shirt-business)
* [Growing your business with push notifications](https://www.builder.ai/guides/push-notifications)

>**“*Scott's ability to patiently take in complex and creatively challenging briefs is second to none! His speed of delivery and transparency throughout the project is also a big plus - particularly for a start up / scale up environment where one needs to move a thousand miles an hour and in multiple directions. A wonderful, organic extension to the team!*”** – Bastien Eymery, Head of Growth at Builder.ai
