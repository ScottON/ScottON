I’m Scott.

**I want to be your copywriter.**

You know the power of good copy. It’s why you're reading this. You want more email signups, increased ad click-throughs, and ultimately more sales.

Unfortunately, you've also seen bad copy before :
It’s horrible spam-esque writing that you automatically close before reading a word.
It’s riddled with spelling and grammar mistakes.
It’s obviously written by someone who isn’t a native speaker.
It’s a HUGE waste of your money.

That's what you're probably used to with other copywriters. They just want to take your money, send you some awful copy, and disappear. 
## I work differently...

You'll not have those issues if you work with me. I don’t want you to waste your money. I want you to be so happy with the results that you immediately think of me for your next project. Tell me the aim of the piece, the target market, and I'll handle the rest. You carry on smashing your goals – or drinking wine, no judgement – while I craft the copy you deserve.

<blockquote>"10/10 incredible freelancer, Scott has great range, commits to the project, and takes pride in his work. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend him to family or friends... If you need anything from business copywriting to creative content writing Scott will get it done." – James Wilson | That American Grind. </blockquote>
## What makes me unique:
I’ve written successful landing pages, blogs, email campaigns, and ads for my clients. They cover a range of industries: fintech, recruitment, skincare, software development, and education to name a few.

I was awarded a Master of Arts degree in Philosophy. It's best described as a communication and persuasive writing degree with a fancy intellectual wrapper. It's developed a multitude of skills that I bring to the table:

**Clear and concise writing** – you want people to immediately understand why your product is great.
**Research skills** – I'll research your business, main competitors, and voice of customer (VOC) to find unique selling points that will speak to your customers.
**Analytical skills** – a lot of copy is based on very shaky arguments. This lowers your trustworthiness and can cost you sales. I've got the background required to create emotional copy that can’t be dismissed for outlandish claims.

<blockquote>“This is one of my favorite emails I've received this year!” – Jacob McMillen | #1 U.S. search result for ‘copywriter’</blockquote>
## What to expect if you hire me:
  * **Questionnaire & Call** – this lets me understand your expectations, how you view your business, and get a feel for your company's ‘voice’.
  * **Research** –  I’ll investigate what’s working for your competitors and what customers say about your products.
  * **Writing** – not long after that, you’ll receive a well-written, compelling piece of copy.
  * **Happiness check** – we’ll confirm you’re happy with the work. If not, no worries. I’ll address anything you’d like done differently and promptly send you a revised version.

By this point, you should realise the advantages of hiring me as your copywriter. You now need to decide how to proceed.
### Option #1: Maintain the status quo

Carry on as you have been. Close this tab and stop looking to hire someone. Either write your own copy or use your usual writer. Either way, you’ll keep getting EXACTLY the same results you’ve always had...

As you’re looking for a copywriter, I imagine you don't want this. You want to ‘level up’ your business. That leaves you with two options.

### Option #2: Hire someone else

Waste your money on the cheap, badly written copy we discussed earlier... It came in late again! Before you can use it, you’ll have to fix the spelling, grammar, and broken English. Ugh! You’ll have to rearrange that meeting to fix it...

You get to waste your money and time in this scenario. Hiring a copywriter is meant to make your life easier.

### Option #3: Hire me

I put my abilities to use for you. I’ll use my unique research process to gather the information I need. Then, I write and polish the copy so your customer is begging to buy. You can sit back and relax while I handle it. Professional copy sent to you by the agreed deadline. Unlimited revisions with my 100% satisfaction guarantee.

It’s time for you to choose. If you’ve reached this point then I imagine you’ve taken a liking to option #3. Have a look at the services I offer below.
