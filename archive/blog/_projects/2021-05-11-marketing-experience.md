## Always learning

I’m a big believer in life-long learning. 

It’s why my digital marketing education is never going to be complete. There’s always more to learn. 

That being said, I’ve made a good dent in the topic.

I love the Inbound methodology – attract, engage, and delight your customers. Provide value to prospects rather than *trick* them with gimmicky sales tactics. Why?

Happy customers will promote your business for you. They’re the key to 10x your sales.

This doesn’t mean abandoning what already works. The Inbound principles can be applied to all the digital marketing you already do: ads, emails, social media, sales pages, etc...

Why trust me? I have extensive practical experience **and** I've studied the best practices of digital marketing.

## Other
I’m constantly reading books related to marketing, sales, and writing. It's a never-ending process to ensure my writing consistently uses the most powerful techniques.

Lastly, I’m in regular contact with multiple six-figure copywriters. They began as mentors and many are now part of my trusted network of friends. We share insider knowledge about what works best across a range of industries.
